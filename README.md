# Deep Learning from Scratch (PyTorch) üî•

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of deep learning models implemented from scratch in PyTorch**.  
The goal: rebuild all major architectures, understand their inner workings, and provide an educational reference for the community.

## üîç Vision
Recreate **every major deep learning model**, using **PyTorch only** (no pretrained weights, no high-level wrappers):

- **Classical Networks**: Perceptron, Logistic Regression, MLP  
- **CNNs**: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet  
- **RNNs**: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU  
- **Transformers**: Attention, GPT, BERT, Vision Transformers  
- **Generative Models**: Autoencoders, GANs, Diffusion Models  
- **Advanced Models**: Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning agents
